Flicklib
=========

Preliminary support code and API library for the Flick HAT, Flick Zero and Flick Large.
The library is derived from Pimoroni's skywriter library (https://github.com/pimoroni/skywriter-hat).

Flicklib needs i2c enabled, you can use raspi-config to do this.

```
git clone https://github.com/PiSupply/Flick
